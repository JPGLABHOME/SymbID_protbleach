I believe the samples had previously been quantified using a NanoDrop. However, looking at the values, many of them are below 5ng/uL, which I have found to be unreliable when using a NanoDrop. The Qubit hsDNA Assay is significantly more sensitive and more accurate at very low sample concentrations.\n\nThe assay was run following the manufacturer's protocol. I used 1uL of DNA per reaction (i.e. 1uL of sample added to 199uL of buffer/dye mixture). Measurements were run on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 machine.\n\n# Results\n\nRaw data file is here:\n\n- [`QubitData_2023-11-05_09-25-30.csv`](../../../data/qubit/QubitData_2023-11-05_09-25-30.csv)\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick glance at the data reveals that there are 20 samples that have _no_ DNA present in them. I'll mention this to Jackie. In the meantime, I'll start testing out the three primer sets.",
