    "text": "Intro\nTo begin this project, I opted to re-quantify all of the DNA samples provided using the Qubit high senstivity DNA Assay (hsDNA; Invitrogen). I believe the samples had previously been quantified using a NanoDrop. However, looking at the values, many of them are below 5ng/uL, which I have found to be unreliable when using a NanoDrop. The Qubit hsDNA Assay is significantly more sensitive and more accurate at very low sample concentrations.\nThe assay was run following the manufacturer’s protocol. I used 1uL of DNA per reaction (i.e. 1uL of sample added to 199uL of buffer/dye mixture). Measurements were run on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 machine.\n\n\nResults\nRaw data file is here:\n\nQubitData_2023-11-05_09-25-30.csv\n\nA quick glance at the data reveals that there are 20 samples that have no DNA present in them. I’ll mention this to Jackie. In the meantime, I’ll start testing out the three primer sets."

    "text": "After quantifying the DNA and awaiting a response no how to handle the lack of DNA in 20 of the samples, I decided to create a serial dilution of some pooled DNA and test the three primer sets. I’d like to get a sense for their specificity, as well as their sensitivity.\nAll primers had been previously ordered/prepped by Tanya Brown. It’s my understanding that all three primer set sequences have been taken directly from previously published articles. One caveat is that those articles used these primer sets along with a probe oligo. Due to costs/time, these qPCRs (and all subsequent qPCRs) were performed using SYBR green (i.e. no probe oligo).\n\nCAct (C symbiont) (Ross Cunning and Baker 2012)\nDAct (D symbiont) (Ross Cunning and Baker 2012)\nMcap_PaxC (R.
