I’m wondering if the sensitivity of this primer is low enough that it’s causing a large (i.e. ~3 Cq) swing in Cqs between replicates. I’ll repeat this using the 10,000pg (10ng) stock to see if this improves replication…"

I believe the samples had previously been quantified using a NanoDrop. However, looking at the values, many of them are below 5ng/uL, which I have found to be unreliable when using a NanoDrop. The Qubit hsDNA Assay is significantly more sensitive and more accurate at very low sample concentrations.\nThe assay was run following the manufacturer’s protocol. I used 1uL of DNA per reaction (i.e. 1uL of sample added to 199uL of buffer/dye mixture). Measurements were run on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 machine.\n\n\nResults\nRaw data file is here:\n\nQubitData_2023-11-05_09-25-30.csv\n\nA quick glance at the data reveals that there are 20 samples that have no DNA present in them.

Black line is 1,000pg input DNA and corresponds to a Cq value of ~37. We see both replicates of the 10,000pg input DNA samples produce amplificaiton, however the variation between replicates was attrocious. While with the 1,000pg input DNA sample, I’ve managed to reproduce this behavior across three different qPCRs! Only a single replicate ampflifies at a Cq of ~37. The resulting melt curves looks good (i.e. narrow peaks, same melt temp across reps/samples.)."
